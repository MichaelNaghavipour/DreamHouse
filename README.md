1 Overview
The game objectives are to build customized houses or structures based on each level requirements. This will be a unique game that gives a player the opportunity to test his/her imagination and creativity on building structures to fulfill acceptance criteria of each levels. The platform of the game will be MacOS. It will be suitable for players with +5 years of age. In the game there are other NPC’s that interact with the player and guide him/her through the game rules. They tell the player about their dream house and their needs, and the player should build a house to make their dreams into reality.


1.1 Game abstract
Pass each level by building the people’s dream house and collect money from them, and with your money you can build your dream house too. 

1.2 Objectives to be achieved by the game
The game will provide a sense of satisfactory for the player by helping people to achieve their dreams. This will be a game in which the player never feels bored or tired of playing and by passing each level, he/she tries to go further and build better and more efficient buildings. It also provides good examples for the people who are interested in historical architecture and structural design. 

1.3 Core gameplay
The player will try to first investigate the world he is in, then he will be encouraged to build something for himself, but since he does not have any money at first, he needs to interact with other NPC’s and build something for them based on their needs to earn money. If something goes wrong, they pay nothing to him and it will be a waste of time and money. But if what he builds is satisfactory, then he gain money. Now it is time to invest money on building a private palace which make the game more fun.

1.4 Game features
The game will have some unique features including an open world full of different assest and NPC’s. Beautiful and customized buildings. Building simulation. Getting scores and points. Interacting with other characters. Earning points or rewards by playing.

1.4.1 Genre
Building (Architecture) Simulation

1.4.2 Number of players
This game will be a single player game.

1.4.3 Game theme
The game theme will be in a time period before BC

1.4.4 Story summary
It is 2500 BC and a new tribe is tired of fighting and struggling with other humans and creatures. So they decided to migrate to a new land in Middle East. There is no other humans there except some dangerous creatures and animals. They should build shelters and quickly create a safe place for their children and weak people to protect them from the outdoor dangers and threats. The grand architect (Main Player) is there to help them.



2 Mechanics
[This section describes the game elements, its attributes, and its interaction rules. All elements that create the game must be detailed and described in this section. A game character, its visual aspect, its sound effects, its personality may be described in this section].

2.1 Game elements categories
The game includes enemies, music, animals, insects, buildings.

2.2 Rules
The player is allowed to walk or run by through the defined world without limitation except some personal properties, interact with the people who need help in which they ask the player for help, create buildings after he agrees to builds something for someone, paint the building with a set of colors based on NPC’s requirements, collect points.

2.2.1 Interaction rules
The game elements cannot overlap each other, e.g the player cannot pass through a building or any other elements in game. People are waiting for the player to interact with them by going to them and accept their request. When a building is built correctly, other creatures or enemies cannot pass through or destroy them.

2.2.2 Artificial Intelligence
In the time of danger or peace, the music changes accordingly. Base of the time of the day, the game may be at night or day mode. At nights there are fewer people out there, but more enemies may attach them too.

2.3 Game world elements
There are some portals to other parts of the land that can be used by player. Some people may ride some animals.

2.4 Game log elements
The game will consists of a point system based on what the player achieved in game. He/she received rewards and achievements by passing each quiz. The game could be saved only after the current mission is done.

2.5 Other elements
There are no specific elements out of the classification scope.

2.6 Assets list
The game includes humans, animals, insects, communications, ground, sky, clouds, sun, trees, blocks, stones, woods, building materials, colors for painting	, sounds, good and bad animals, enemies, trades, making money,



3 Dynamics
[This section describes the flow of the game. History, levels, chapters, puzzles, interfaces (hardware and software). This section is directly related with the mechanics section since the dynamics are constructed from the elements in the mechanics].

3.1 Game World
[This section describes the world where the game is played].

3.1.1 Game theme details
The world will be a very big land with nature elements, somehow simulating the world before BC with specific creatures and costumes of the people from that time. The player feels he/she is living among those people and receives a feeling of history and excitement.

3.1.2 Missions/levels/chapters Flow
The navigation in linear and there are restriction to enter some areas. The player should complete the missions (creating building) but there is no priority on doing one earlier. So he can move in a chosen pace.

3.2 Missions/levels/chapters elements
[This section describes the elements that will form the core gameplay].

3.2.1 Objectives
The game may have 20 levels/chapters but there will be no cut between these chapters. The Player should finish a project before he could be able to move to another one. Step by step.

3.2.2 Rewards
After completing every mission, the player will receive gold/money.

3.2.3 Challenges
The most important challenges will be completing the missions in a way to fulfill the requirements or acceptance criteria of the NPC’s, e.g an NPC asks the player to help him build a safe house for his ships before the wolfs attack, Here the player should pay attention to choose the proper materials for that.

3.3 Special areas
There is a safe box in which player can save his golds or money for later use. There is also a profile in which the player can track the game progress.

3.4 Game interface
Player can set a name for himself which will be shown in game he will be called by that name. There are options to sell or buy assets and the ability to look at inside the inventory.

3.5 Controls interface
For profile screen, the player is able to edit information and open or close it. For the moving game, the camera will follow him and he is also able to change the angle of the screen by mouse and keyboard.

3.6 Game Balance
The player will be able to change the weather or make the enemies stronger. He may enforce the equipments he use in buildings to avoid heavy damages.
4 Visuals and Sounds
[This section details what the player sees and hears. This section can be extended in case of augmented reality games like the inclusion of smells].

4.1 Game visuals 
For visualization I used a terrain and other illustrations for UI elements. There is a large terrain with grasses and trees and hills. Later I add many other things and will make it a forest. There is a third person character but still in a capsule model. There are many things to build a house such as roof, floor, door, wall, windows.


4.2 Game sounds
I have not added any sounds yet.
But will do in the coming versions.
